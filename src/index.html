            Hi! My name is Rafa.

            I'm a brazillian non-binary person, passionate about communities, diversity and, of course, coding.
            I've graduated in Digital Games in the State University of Bahia (UNEB), which is a very prestigious
            public university in Brazil. I finished college in 2020.

            I also did a 2-year course certification in PlayGame by SAGA (School of Arts, Game and Animation), concluded
            in 2019.

            Currently, I'm a Post-grad student in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence with the PUCRS University.

            I'm proficient in several programming skills and game engines.

            I've worked with agile methods in all of my projects and developed managed, and mantained tasks and
            project development.

            Also, I can speak Portuguese, English, French and LIBRAS (the brazillian sign language). Cool, right?
        </p>
